.SH "NAME"
kura5 \- A 3D Boktai fangame that uses live weather

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBKura5: Bonds of the Undying\fR
is a non-canonical fan game for the Boktai series and it's successor, Lunar Knights. It's neither a full remake nor a sequel, but a remix of both familiar Boktai staples and new elements that seek to recreate the magic that we all loved from the series. Kura5's weather system knows where you are in the real world, so there's no need for a solar sensor. In-game events may even play out differently depending on if you play in darkness or in light...And that's just the start\&!
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Built on the Unity 3D engine, the \fBkura5\fR executable accepts the standard Unity Standalone Player command line arguments. This list only covers the ones relevant to the Linux version of the game. Multiple non-conflicting options may be used simultaneously\&.
